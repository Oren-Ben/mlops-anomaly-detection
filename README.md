# mlops-anomaly-detection

To run the models and compare them to the baselines:
1. Install the dependencies in the in the requirements.txt
2. Change directory to v1_model_schemes and run the file final_lgbm.py
3. Change directory to v1_model_schemes and run the fil final_lstm.py
4. Examples to the code can be found at:

# mlops-anomaly-detection

To run the models and compare them to the baselines:
1. Install the dependencies in the in the requirements.txt
2. Change directory to v1_model_schemes and run the file final_lgbm.py
3. Change directory to v1_model_schemes and run the fil final_lstm.py
4. More Examples and Plots code can be found at:
    * lgbm_model_evaluation.ipynb - Same as  final_lgbm.py with additional plots
    * lgbm_run.ipynb - Example of the pipeline and model evaluation.
    * lstm_model_evaluation.ipynb - Same as  final_lstm.py with additional plots
    * lstm_run.ipynb - Example of the pipeline and model evaluation.
